# GitHub Actions page sizes

As of 2025-08-07, Both the `arm64` and `x64` architectures in GitHub Actions
use a `4096` (4K) page size. This is according to a
[simple GitHub Actions config](https://github.com/leaf-node/github-actions-arm64-page-size/blob/main/.github/workflows/pagesize_check.yml).
See the text files on the
[releases page](https://github.com/leaf-node/github-actions-arm64-page-size/releases)
for a confirmation of these results.
